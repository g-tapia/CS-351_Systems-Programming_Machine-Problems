# CS-351-Systems-Programming-

This repository contains all the labs from my CS351 class at IIT. For detailed descriptions of each lab, refer to the respective PDF files.

Note: For the Buffer overflow attack lab, click on the attack lab pdf for the description.

For those who are curious about our coursework, you can navigate to my professor's page to find the PDF containing the description of the Attack Lab (also known as the buffer overflow attack lab) through [this link](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs351/). Additionally, if anyone is interested in learning more about one of my favorite professors, you can visit his [main page](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/).

Lab 1 and Lab 2 are not available since we didn't have to submit anything for them. We simply connected to the server, and our professor was notified when we successfully passed each phase. I took a screenshot of the score I received for each lab. I am represented by the yellow highlight below.

**Lab 1 (Binary Bomb - Results)**: Note that I did not lose any points on this because I honed my skills on setting breakpoints efficiently using GDB. The challenge was fairly straightforward; I set a breakpoint before the function that would explode the bomb was called.
